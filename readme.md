</br>

> ⚠️ buck is still a WIP with minimal working commands and features.

# Installation

At the moment the only way to install **buck** is building it from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhygg/buck 
cd buck 
go get
```

To run buck on the current terminal window:

```bash
go install
```

# Usage

Currently the only **working** command is `add`. 
**Buck** has also successfully implemented a module caching paradigm as of now.

Example:

```bash
buck add express
```
